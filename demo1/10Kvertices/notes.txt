The folder rawPointData contains:
====================================================================
1. mydata.ver (this point dataset generated by qHull, text file)
sudo apt-get install qhull-bin

#Change number of points in rbox command and path in ConvertFile and cp (last command)
#Number of point, for ex: 1000 --> mean 1004 points, and the path should be ./dataSource/1Kvertices
#First, use rbox to create random point in square (0,0)--(1,1)
#change input number of points in rbox command
rbox 10000 n D2 O0.5 > mydata.ver

2. file mydatabin.ver is point binary file, converted from text file (mydata.ver) use qHullConvert2DFile in convertFile folder
3. mydatabin.ver.xfdl generated by qHullConvert2DFile.



The folder delaunayResults contains:
==================================================================
