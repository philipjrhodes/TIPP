libharu is a library for creating pdf files.  It should be useful for visualizing large meshes.
The project is at git@github.com:libharu/libharu.git

If the libharu directory is empty, then please rerun the git clone command, but add --recurse-submodules, so the libharu repo is properly cloned.

e.g.  

cd ~/git
git clone git@github.com:philipjrhodes/TIPP.git --recurse-submodules


OSX:
The makefile in the pdf directory will work on OSX without modification, but needs some extra packages to be installed. The brew package manager is helpful here: https://brew.sh .  Once brew is installed, run

 brew install autoconf automake libtool libpng

and the makefile should work. An alternative is to use cmake, but the makefile doesn't use that tool.
