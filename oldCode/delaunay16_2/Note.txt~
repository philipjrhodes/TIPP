- Multiple master

- for experiments, not visualization





- The init Delaunay Triangle is improved similar to the DT of slave nodes
- Triangulate on MPI master node run in sequential (serial)
- Parallel I/O shared file

- Nunmber of tasks depend on number of cores. (send streaming)
For example: if I have 1000 tasks but 500 cores are available,
then I have to send 500 tasks first, then send 500 later.

- There is one more parameter in r3.sh
