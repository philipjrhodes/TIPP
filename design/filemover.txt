class FileMover
    
    responsibilities:
        send files to/from senders and receivers
        
        if data is too large to be sent in one message, this class
        should send multiple messages transparently.
        
        Should handle file offsets larger than 32 bits
        
    methods:
        setAsReceiver() // set this process as a receiver
        setAsSender() // set this process as a sender
        
        setBufferSize(int) // size of transfer buffer
        
        transfer(srcfile, dstfile)  // called by both senders and receivers
                    // may take multiple rounds of transfers to
                    // handle large data
